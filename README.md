## Git intro


![Git Intro](https://github.com/Menchynskyi/kottans-frontend/blob/master/task_git_intro/git_intro.JPG "Git and GitHub")

Thrilling experience. A lot of new information. The concept of version-control is so exciting. Just want to go forward and work more with it.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP


![Linux CLI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Menchynskyi/kottans-frontend/master/task_linux_cli/task_linux_cli.JPG "Learn the Command Line")

There were a lot of new information and practice for me. I've already faced CLI in git intro task, but now  I feel more confidence. What about HTTP protocol it's rather unclear, but I will come back to that later.

Wow! That was amazing. After Git Intro task I thought I knew enough about Git and GitHub, but gosh i was wrong! Git is so powerfull tool and now I want to use it in every project. A lot of new info and now all are clearly.

I've already had html and css experience before this course, but this task refreshed all this stuff in my memory so I can move forward. Maybe some new info about cascading, priority and selectors. Accidentally done html basics course, I guess it wouldn't hurt, tho. ðŸ˜…

## Responsive Web Design


**Responsive Web Design Fundamentals**

**Flexbox Froggy**

I've already faced bootstrap before, but that was kinda user experience not dev. Now I know more explicitly how the pattern works. P.S. an art - not a science. ðŸ˜Š

## HTML & CSS practice


**Popup**
* [demo](https://menchynskyi.github.io/popup-html-css/)
* [repo](https://github.com/Menchynskyi/popup-html-css)

**Requirements:**
* no JavaScript, only HTML/CSS, use of preprocessors is allowed
* no external libraries or frameworks
* browser support: Chrome only (feel free to use latest features)

## JS Basics


**Intro to JS**
![Intro to JS](https://github.com/Menchynskyi/kottans-frontend/blob/master/task_js_basics/intro_to_js.JPG "Intro to JS")

**FreeCodeCamp exercises**
* [Basic JavaScript](https://github.com/Menchynskyi/kottans-frontend/blob/master/task_js_basics/basic_javascript.PNG)
* [ES6 Challenges](https://github.com/Menchynskyi/kottans-frontend/blob/master/task_js_basics/es6_challenges.jpg)
* [Basic Data Structures](https://github.com/Menchynskyi/kottans-frontend/blob/master/task_js_basics/basic_data_structures.jpg)
* [Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://github.com/Menchynskyi/kottans-frontend/blob/master/task_js_basics/basic_algorithm_scripting.jpg)
* [Functional Programming](https://github.com/Menchynskyi/kottans-frontend/blob/master/task_js_basics/functional_programming.jpg)
* [Algorithm Scripting Challenges](https://github.com/Menchynskyi/kottans-frontend/blob/master/task_js_basics/algorithm_scripting_challenges.jpg)

That was quite tough. I had to use hints and google a lot. After my true solutions I've compared my code with their and tried to figure out how could I do it better. It took a long time.
