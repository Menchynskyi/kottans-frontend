Thrilling experience. A lot of new information. The concept of version-control is so exciting. Just want to go forward and work more with it.

There were a lot of new information and practice for me. I've already faced CLI in git intro task, but now  I feel more confidence. What about HTTP protocol it's rather unclear, but I will come back to that later.
